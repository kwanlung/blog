# Life Lessons

1. **Always Remember to Live in the Present**

   Shi Tiesheng once wrote:

   “When I was healthy and whole, I often complained about the poor environment around me. After I became paralyzed, I yearned for the days when I could walk and run. A few years later, when I developed bedsores, I missed the time I could sit comfortably in a wheelchair. Later, when I was diagnosed with kidney failure, I longed for the days with just bedsores. As more years passed, I needed dialysis and was awake only rarely. At that point, I missed having kidney failure. Alexandre Dumas once said something similar: life has no absolute happiness or unhappiness; it is merely a comparison of two different circumstances.”

   – Shi Tiesheng, *Notes on Idleness*

   In summary: If you stand at the perspective of childhood looking toward the future, you might say your prospects are uncertain or limitless. However, if you stand at the end and look back at the trajectory of life, you only see a single path—a destined road. Not knowing what fate is allows us to understand what fate means. Therefore, when people claim they cannot see the future, it often means they have already glimpsed it. The only certainty in life is its inherent uncertainty. So, boldly do what you wish to do, live in the present, and embrace all the beauty around you.

2. **A Recommendation for All Hesitant Young People**

   Read this sentence repeatedly:

   *Everyone’s opinions and judgments are temporary. Only your own experiences and achievements will stay with you for a lifetime. Most fears and worries come from your imagination. Once you truly take action, you’ll discover how much joy there is.*

3. **The Two Most Important Things in Life**

   First, excel in your career.  
   Second, find the right partner.

   When the sun rises, devote yourself to your work. When it sets, embrace your loved one. That is, perhaps, the meaning of our efforts. When kindness meets kindness, it is the most beautiful encounter in the world. When kindness meets gentleness, it becomes a perfect match on earth.

4. **Never Care About What Others Think of You**

   Remember, this applies to anyone—especially those unrelated to you. Many people deliberately belittle you, look down on you, and try to make you unhappy. They might insult you out of jealousy. These things only add unnecessary emotional burden. If you take such people seriously and care too much about them, you let them win. In this world, aside from life and death, everything else is trivial—not even worth calling a scratch. You can never satisfy everyone. The darkest part of human nature is the inability to accept that someone else might live better than oneself.

5. **Allocate Your Time Wisely**

   Spend time on sleep, books, exercise, flowers, birds, trees, mountains, rivers, and your love for this world. Do not waste it on unimportant people and trivial matters.

   When you start mastering your time, you’ll feel the quiet power that emerges from a simple life. As for anxiety and unease, they will naturally dissipate like smoke.

6. **Money is not something you should spend your whole life earning. Instead, seize the opportunities that allow you to earn in 2-3 years what most people can’t earn in a lifetime.**

So, if you believe you are currently at your most profitable stage, please remind yourself not to rest, okay?
Because you never know when the next opportunity like this will come again. Once you miss it, it might never come back.

---

7. **Sensitivity + Detachment = Unstoppable in Life**

Don’t pry into other people’s lives, don’t speculate about their thoughts, and don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future. Any person or thing that causes you mental exhaustion isn’t worth a second thought.
Reclaim your time and energy for yourself. Stay true to your heart amidst the noise of fame and fortune, and walk your own path amidst the scrutiny of the world.
Translation: "None of your business" + "None of my business" = A peaceful life.

8. **Since ancient times, nothing is more dangerous than being overfilled.**

Be half poor, half rich, and live contentedly.
Be half deaf, half mute, and half oblivious.
Be half wise, half foolish, and half sage.
Be half human, half self, and half free.
Be half awake, half drunk, and half divine.
Be half affectionate, half suffering, and half joyful.
Be half worldly, half meditative, and half following destiny.
Half of life is within your control; the other half, leave to nature.
