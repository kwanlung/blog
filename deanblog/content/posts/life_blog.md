# Life Lessons

1. **Always Remember to Live in the Present**

   Shi Tiesheng once wrote:

   “When I was healthy and whole, I often complained about the poor environment around me. After I became paralyzed, I yearned for the days when I could walk and run. A few years later, when I developed bedsores, I missed the time I could sit comfortably in a wheelchair. Later, when I was diagnosed with kidney failure, I longed for the days with just bedsores. As more years passed, I needed dialysis and was awake only rarely. At that point, I missed having kidney failure. Alexandre Dumas once said something similar: life has no absolute happiness or unhappiness; it is merely a comparison of two different circumstances.”

   – Shi Tiesheng, *Notes on Idleness*

   In summary: If you stand at the perspective of childhood looking toward the future, you might say your prospects are uncertain or limitless. However, if you stand at the end and look back at the trajectory of life, you only see a single path—a destined road. Not knowing what fate is allows us to understand what fate means. Therefore, when people claim they cannot see the future, it often means they have already glimpsed it. The only certainty in life is its inherent uncertainty. So, boldly do what you wish to do, live in the present, and embrace all the beauty around you.

2. **A Recommendation for All Hesitant Young People**

   Read this sentence repeatedly:

   *Everyone’s opinions and judgments are temporary. Only your own experiences and achievements will stay with you for a lifetime. Most fears and worries come from your imagination. Once you truly take action, you’ll discover how much joy there is.*

3. **The Two Most Important Things in Life**

   First, excel in your career.  
   Second, find the right partner.

   When the sun rises, devote yourself to your work. When it sets, embrace your loved one. That is, perhaps, the meaning of our efforts. When kindness meets kindness, it is the most beautiful encounter in the world. When kindness meets gentleness, it becomes a perfect match on earth.

4. **Never Care About What Others Think of You**

   Remember, this applies to anyone—especially those unrelated to you. Many people deliberately belittle you, look down on you, and try to make you unhappy. They might insult you out of jealousy. These things only add unnecessary emotional burden. If you take such people seriously and care too much about them, you let them win. In this world, aside from life and death, everything else is trivial—not even worth calling a scratch. You can never satisfy everyone. The darkest part of human nature is the inability to accept that someone else might live better than oneself.

5. **Allocate Your Time Wisely**

   Spend time on sleep, books, exercise, flowers, birds, trees, mountains, rivers, and your love for this world. Do not waste it on unimportant people and trivial matters.

   When you start mastering your time, you’ll feel the quiet power that emerges from a simple life. As for anxiety and unease, they will naturally dissipate like smoke.
